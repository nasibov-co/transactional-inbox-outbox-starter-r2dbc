# Transactional Inbox/Outbox R2DBC Starter

A lightweight Spring Boot starter for implementing transactional inbox/outbox processing with **R2DBC** and **Kotlin coroutines**.

The starter polls event rows from your database, dispatches them to typed handlers, applies retry rules, and moves exhausted events to `DEAD_LETTER`.

## Installation

Gradle Kotlin DSL:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("io.github.fnasibov:transactional-inbox-outbox-starter-r2dbc:1.0.3")
}
```

The consuming application must also provide a configured R2DBC connection and a `ReactiveTransactionManager`.

## Project Modules

This repository follows the Spring Boot starter layout:

| Module | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `transactional-inbox-outbox-autoconfigure-r2dbc` | Auto-configuration, public API, domain implementation, configuration metadata, and tests. |
| `transactional-inbox-outbox-starter-r2dbc` | Thin starter artifact that brings the auto-configure module and required runtime dependencies. |

## Quick Start

### 1. Define an event entity

Each event type is a Spring Data R2DBC entity and must implement `Event`.

```kotlin
import com.fnasibov.transactional.inbox.outbox.starter.r2dbc.api.model.Event
import com.fnasibov.transactional.inbox.outbox.starter.r2dbc.api.model.EventStatus
import org.springframework.data.annotation.Id
import org.springframework.data.relational.core.mapping.Table
import java.time.ZonedDateTime
import java.util.UUID

@Table("payment_events")
data class PaymentEvent(
    @Id
    override val id: UUID,
    override val status: EventStatus = EventStatus.PENDING,
    override val createdAt: ZonedDateTime = ZonedDateTime.now(),
    override val updatedAt: ZonedDateTime? = null,
    override val retryCount: Int = 0,
    override val lastAttemptAt: ZonedDateTime? = null,
    override val nextRetryAt: ZonedDateTime? = null,

    val paymentId: UUID,
    val amount: Long,
    val currency: String
) : Event
```

The table name is read from `@Table`, so the annotation is required for default polling.

### 2. Create the table

The default repository expects the lifecycle columns from `Event` to exist in snake case.

```sql
CREATE TABLE payment_events (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    status VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    retry_count INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    last_attempt_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    next_retry_at TIMESTAMPTZ,

    payment_id UUID NOT NULL,
    amount BIGINT NOT NULL,
    currency VARCHAR(3) NOT NULL
);

CREATE INDEX idx_payment_events_polling
    ON payment_events (status, next_retry_at, created_at);
```

### 3. Register a handler

Every event type that should be processed must have at least one `EventHandler` bean.

```kotlin
import com.fnasibov.transactional.inbox.outbox.starter.r2dbc.api.EventHandler
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component

@Component
class PaymentEventHandler(
    private val paymentPublisher: PaymentPublisher
) : EventHandler<PaymentEvent> {

    override fun supportedEventType(): Class<PaymentEvent> =
        PaymentEvent::class.java

    override suspend fun handle(event: PaymentEvent) {
        paymentPublisher.publish(
            paymentId = event.paymentId,
            amount = event.amount,
            currency = event.currency
        )
    }

    override suspend fun handleDeadLetter(event: PaymentEvent, error: Throwable) {
        // Called only when the event is moved to DEAD_LETTER.
        // Use it for logging, metrics, alerts, or compensating actions.
    }
}
```

Multiple handlers can support the same event type. They are executed sequentially for a consumed event; if any handler fails, the event is marked as failed according to the retry policy.

### 4. Enable the starter

```yaml
transactional:
  enabled: true
```

When enabled, auto-configuration creates the repository, processor, coroutine scope, and lifecycle starter. Processing starts with the Spring application.

## Configuration

All properties live under the `transactional` prefix.

```yaml
transactional:
  enabled: true

  polling:
    # Polling interval while events are available.
    active-interval: 100ms

    # Maximum idle interval after exponential backoff when no events are found.
    max-idle-interval: 30s

    # Number of rows fetched by one poller in one database batch.
    batch-size: 15

    # Internal channel capacity between pollers and workers.
    channel-capacity: 25

    # Time after which PROCESSING events are considered stale and eligible again.
    processing-stale-timeout: 5m

  processing:
    # Number of worker coroutines consuming events from the shared channel.
    concurrency: 5

    # Maximum time to drain already fetched events during shutdown.
    shutdown-timeout: 30s

  retry:
    # Number of failed processing attempts before DEAD_LETTER.
    max-attempts: 3

    # Exponential backoff settings before a FAILED event is retried.
    initial-delay: 1s
    multiplier: 2.0
    max-delay: 1m
```

Defaults:

| Property | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `transactional.enabled` | `false` |
| `transactional.polling.active-interval` | `100ms` |
| `transactional.polling.max-idle-interval` | `30s` |
| `transactional.polling.batch-size` | `15` |
| `transactional.polling.channel-capacity` | `25` |
| `transactional.polling.processing-stale-timeout` | `5m` |
| `transactional.processing.concurrency` | `5` |
| `transactional.processing.shutdown-timeout` | `30s` |
| `transactional.retry.max-attempts` | `3` |
| `transactional.retry.initial-delay` | `1s` |
| `transactional.retry.multiplier` | `2.0` |
| `transactional.retry.max-delay` | `1m` |

Duration properties support readable values such as `100ms`, `1s`, `30s`, and `1m`.

### Deprecated configuration aliases

The following legacy property names are still accepted for backward compatibility, but are deprecated and should be migrated to the new names.

| Deprecated property | Use instead |
| --- | --- |
| `transactional.polling.active-interval-ms` | `transactional.polling.active-interval` |
| `transactional.polling.max-idle-interval-ms` | `transactional.polling.max-idle-interval` |
| `transactional.polling.max-concurrency` | `transactional.processing.concurrency` |
| `transactional.retry.max-immediate-attempts` | `transactional.retry.max-attempts` |
| `transactional.retry.initial-delay-ms` | `transactional.retry.initial-delay` |

## Custom Batch Fetching

By default, the starter fetches eligible events from the table mapped by `@Table`, locks them with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, updates their status to `PROCESSING`, and returns the selected entities.

Register `FetchBatchStrategy` when an event type needs custom selection, priority ordering, partitioning, or database-specific locking.

```kotlin
import com.fnasibov.transactional.inbox.outbox.starter.r2dbc.api.FetchBatchStrategy
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component

@Component
class PaymentFetchStrategy(
    private val repository: CustomPaymentEventRepository
) : FetchBatchStrategy<PaymentEvent> {

    override val eventType: Class<PaymentEvent> =
        PaymentEvent::class.java

    override suspend fun fetchBatch(): List<PaymentEvent> {
        return repository.fetchPriorityBatch()
    }
}
```

Custom strategies are responsible for their own locking, transaction boundaries, and status transitions.

## Processing Flow

```text
Database -> EventPoller -> Channel -> EventWorker -> EventHandler(s)
```

For each registered event type, the starter starts a poller. Fetched events are sent into a shared coroutine channel and consumed by worker coroutines.

Lifecycle statuses:

```text
PENDING -> PROCESSING -> PROCESSED
                    \-> FAILED -> PROCESSING
                    \-> DEAD_LETTER
```

Failure behavior:

- Handler failures call `markAsFailed`.
- Failed events are retried with exponential backoff using `retry.initial-delay`, `retry.multiplier`, and `retry.max-delay`.
- Once `retry.max-attempts` is reached, the event moves to `DEAD_LETTER`.
- `handleDeadLetter` is called only after the event reaches `DEAD_LETTER`.

## Observability

When a `MeterRegistry` is available, the starter publishes Micrometer meters:

| Meter | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `transactional.events.fetched` | Number of events fetched for processing |
| `transactional.events.processed` | Number of successfully processed events |
| `transactional.events.failed` | Number of processing failures |
| `transactional.events.dead_letter` | Number of events moved to `DEAD_LETTER` |
| `transactional.events.processing.duration` | Handler processing duration |

When Spring Boot health contributor support is on the classpath, the starter also contributes a `transactionalInboxOutboxHealthIndicator` bean.

## Notes

- The starter is database-backed and does not require an external broker.
- Default polling uses `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, so it is intended for databases that support this locking style.
- A handler is required for an event type to be polled because pollers are created from registered handler event types.
- Event classes can contain any domain-specific columns in addition to the fields required by `Event`.
